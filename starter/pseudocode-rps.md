# Data analysis pseudocode


Analyse 2 things: 
Data 
Profit/Losees

Write code to analyse records and calculate the total number of of months included on this data set

The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period

The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

Track what the total change in profits is from month to month to then find the average

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

Ideas: 

totalMonth
lastMonthFinances = a
currentMonthFinance = b
changes = a - b
